///Inspired by the `MVC` design pattern, this moves some view-related logic to the controller.
///To avoid memory leaks or cyclic dependencies, the state instance is taken on demand instead of being stored as an instance variable.
///
/// Since Dart Streams are asynchronous in nature and not as powerful as Kotlin's `StateFlow`,
/// keeping the state in the business logic/controller introduces some noticeable overhead.
/// Moreover, in many cases, it is more efficient to store the state in the view,
/// as the Flutter framework is designed such that in most of cases, state needs to be managed by the view(either explicitly or implicitly).
/// This also helps eliminate redundancy.
